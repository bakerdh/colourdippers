@article{Sincich2005,
	abstract = {Primary and secondary visual cortex (V1 and V2) form the foundation of the cortical visual system. V1 transforms information received from the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and distributes it to separate domains in V2 for transmission to higher visual areas. During the past 20 years, schemes for the functional organization of V1 and V2 have been based on a tripartite framework developed by Livingstone & Hubel (1988) . Since then, new anatomical data have accumulated concerning V1's input, its internal circuitry, and its output to V2. These new data, along with physiological and imaging studies, now make it likely that the visual attributes of color, form, and motion are not neatly segregated by V1 into different stripe compartments in V2. Instead, there are just two main streams, originating from cytochrome oxidase patches and interpatches, that project to V2. Each stream is composed of a mixture of magno, parvo, and konio geniculate signals. Further studies are required to elucidate how the patches and interpatches differ in the output they convey to extrastriate cortex.},

@article{Kaskan2007,
	abstract = {A significant concept in neuroscience is that sensory areas of the neocortex have evolved the remarkable ability to represent a number of stimulus features within the confines of a global map of the sensory periphery. Modularity, the term often used to describe the inhomogeneous nature of the neocortex, is without a doubt an important organizational principle of early sensory areas, such as the primary visual cortex (V1). Ocular dominance columns, one type of module in V1, are found in many primate species as well as in carnivores. Yet, their variable presence in some New World monkey species and complete absence in other species has been enigmatic. Here, we demonstrate that optical imaging reveals the presence of ocular dominance columns in the superficial layers of V1 of owl monkeys (Aotus trivirgatus), even though the geniculate inputs related to each eye are highly overlapping in layer 4. The ocular dominance columns in owl monkeys revealed by optical imaging are circular in appearance. The distance between left eye centers and right eye centers is approximately 650 mum. We find no relationship between ocular dominance centers and other modular organizational features such as orientation pinwheels or the centers of the cytochrome oxidase blobs. These results are significant because they suggest that functional columns may exist in the absence of obvious differences in the distributions of activating inputs and ocular dominance columns may be more widely distributed across mammalian taxa than commonly suggested.},

@article{Chatterjee2021,
	abstract = {The clustering of neurons with similar response properties is a conspicuous feature of neocortex. In primary visual cortex (V1), maps of several properties like orientation preference are well described, but the functional architecture of color, central to visual perception in trichromatic primates, is not. Here we used two-photon calcium imaging in macaques to examine the fine structure of chromatic representation and found that neurons responsive to spatially uniform, chromatic stimuli form unambiguous clusters that coincide with blobs. Further, these responsive groups have marked substructure, segregating into smaller ensembles or micromaps with distinct chromatic signatures that appear columnar in upper layer 2/3. Spatially structured chromatic stimuli revealed maps built on the same micromap framework but with larger subdomains that go well beyond blobs. We conclude that V1 has an architecture for color representation that switches between blobs and a combined blob/interblob system based on the spatial content of the visual scene.},

@article{Horton2005,
	abstract = {This year, the field of neuroscience celebrates the 50th anniversary of Mountcastle's discovery of the cortical column. In this review, we summarize half a century of research and come to the disappointing realization that the column may have no function. Originally, it was described as a discrete structure, spanning the layers of the somatosensory cortex, which contains cells responsive to only a single modality, such as deep joint receptors or cutaneous receptors. Subsequently, examples of columns have been uncovered in numerous cortical areas, expanding the original concept to embrace a variety of different structures and principles. A "column" now refers to cells in any vertical cluster that share the same tuning for any given receptive field attribute. In striate cortex, for example, cells with the same eye preference are grouped into ocular dominance columns. Unaccountably, ocular dominance columns are present in some species, but not others. In principle, it should be possible to determine their function by searching for species differences in visual performance that correlate with their presence or absence. Unfortunately, this approach has been to no avail; no visual faculty has emerged that appears to require ocular dominance columns. Moreover, recent evidence has shown that the expression of ocular dominance columns can be highly variable among members of the same species, or even in different portions of the visual cortex in the same individual. These observations deal a fatal blow to the idea that ocular dominance columns serve a purpose. More broadly, the term "column" also denotes the periodic termination of anatomical projections within or between cortical areas. In many instances, periodic projections have a consistent relationship with some architectural feature, such as the cytochrome oxidase patches in V1 or the stripes in V2. These tissue compartments appear to divide cells with different receptive field properties into distinct processing streams. However, it is unclear what advantage, if any, is conveyed by this form of columnar segregation. Although the column is an attractive concept, it has failed as a unifying principle for understanding cortical function. Unravelling the organization of the cerebral cortex will require a painstaking description of the circuits, projections and response properties peculiar to cells in each of its various areas.},

@article{Economides2011,
	abstract = {The abundant concentration of cytochrome oxidase in patches or blobs of primate striate cortex has never been explained. Patches are thought to contain unoriented, color-opponent neurons. Lacking orientation selectivity, these cells might endow patches with high metabolic activity because they respond to all contours in visual scenes. To test this idea, we measured orientation tuning in layer 2/3 of macaque cortical area V1 using acutely implanted 100-electrode arrays. Each electrode recording site was identified and assigned to the patch or interpatch compartment. The mean orientation bandwidth of cells was 28.4$\,^{\circ}$ in patches and 25.8$\,^{\circ}$ in interpatches. Neurons in patches were indeed less orientation selective, but the difference was subtle, indicating that the processing of form and color is not strictly segregated in V1. The most conspicuous finding was that patch cells had a 49% greater overall firing rate. This global difference in neuronal responsiveness, rather than an absence of orientation tuning, may account for the rich mitochondrial enzyme activity that defines patches.},

@article{Sharpe2011,
	abstract = {Abstract We recently proposed a 2$\,^{\circ}$ photopic luminosity function, VD65*(λ) [J Vis 2005;5:948--968], which improves upon the original CIE 1924 V(λ) function and its modifications, while being consistent with a linear combination of the Stockman and Sharpe [Vis Res 2000;40:1711--1737] long- and middle-wavelength-sensitive cone fundamentals [L(λ) and M(λ), respectively]. Its derivation was based on 25-Hz heterochromatic flicker photometric (HFP) data obtained from 40 observers of known genotype on a 1000 troland white (D65) background. However, as a result of an analysis of new luminous efficiency data obtained on an series of chromatic backgrounds [J Vis 2008;8:1--26], we now recognize that the 25-Hz flickering targets, though near-flicker-threshold, altered the mean chromaticity of the adapting background. Consequently, we have revised the original analysis, taking into account the changes in mean adapting chromaticity with target wavelength. Our reanalysis of the individual and mean data shows that the VD65*(λ) function for a D65 background should be redefined as 1.89L(λ) + M(λ) in quantal terms and as 1.98L(λ) + M(λ) in energy terms. The change in the L-cone weighting factor represents a change in luminous efficiency across the spectrum of ∼0.04 log unit. {\copyright} 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Col Res Appl, 2011},

@article{Pelli1985,
	abstract = {More than 20 years ago, Tanner [Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 89, 752 (1961)] noted that observers asked to detect a signal act as though they are uncertain about the physical characteristics of the signal to be detected. The popular assumptions of probability summation and decision variable, taken together, imply this uncertainty. This paper defines and uncertainty model of visual detection that assumes that the observer is uncertain among many signals and chooses the likeliest. With only four parameters, the uncertainty model explains why d' is approximately a power function of contrast ("nonlinear transduction") and accurately predicts effects of summation, facilitation, noise, subjective criterion, and task for near-threshold contrast. Thus the uncertainty model offers a synthesis of much of our current understanding of visual contrast detection and discrimination.},

@article{Wallis2013,
	abstract = {The slope of the two-interval, forced-choice psychometric function (e.g. the Weibull parameter, β) provides valuable information about the relationship between contrast sensitivity and signal strength. However, little is known about how or whether β varies with stimulus parameters such as spatiotemporal frequency and stimulus size and shape. A second unresolved issue concerns the best way to estimate the slope of the psychometric function. For example, if an observer is non-stationary (e.g. their threshold drifts between experimental sessions), β will be underestimated if curve fitting is performed after collapsing the data across experimental sessions. We measured psychometric functions for 2 experienced observers for 14 different spatiotemporal configurations of pulsed or flickering grating patches and bars on each of 8 days. We found β≈3 to be fairly constant across almost all conditions, consistent with a fixed nonlinear contrast transducer and/or a constant level of intrinsic stimulus uncertainty (e.g. a square law transducer and a low level of intrinsic uncertainty). Our analysis showed that estimating a single β from results averaged over several experimental sessions was slightly more accurate than averaging multiple estimates from several experimental sessions. However, the small levels of non-stationarity (SD≈0.8dB) meant that the difference between the estimates was, in practice, negligible.},

@article{Wendt2024,
	abstract = {The phenomenon of binocular luster can be evoked by simple dichoptic center-surround stimuli showing a luminance contrast difference between the eyes. Previous findings support the idea that this phenomenon is mediated by a low-level conflict mechanism that integrates the monocular signals from different types of contrast detector cells. Also, isoluminant stimuli with different chromatic contrasts between eyes can trigger sensations of luster. Here, we investigate whether the lustrous impression in such purely chromatic stimuli depends on interocular contrast differences and in particular on interocular contrast polarity pairings in a similar way as in the achromatic case. In our experiments, we measured the magnitude of the lustrous response using a series of isoluminant dichoptic center-ring-surround stimuli with varying ring width whose chromatic properties were varied along the red-green and blue-yellow cardinal directions. The trends in the data were very similar to those of our former study with achromatic stimuli, indicating similar mechanisms in both cases. The empirical luster data could also be predicted fairly well by a chromatic version of our interocular conflict model (with overall R2 values between 0.577 and 0.639), for which two different receptive field models were used, simulating the behavior of color-sensitive double-opponent cells in V1.},

@article{Tootell1988,
	abstract = {Using spatially diffuse stimuli (or sinusoidal gratings of very low spatial frequency), levels of 14C-2-deoxy-d-glucose (DG) uptake produced by color-varying stimuli are much greater than those produced by luminance-varying stimuli in macaque striate cortex. Such a difference in DG results is consistent with previous psychophysical and electrophysiological results from man and monkey. In DG experiments with color-varying gratings of low and middle spatial frequencies, or with spatially diffuse color variations, DG uptake was highest in the cytochrome oxidase blobs, as was also seen with low-spatial-frequency luminance gratings. High-spatial-frequency, color-varying uptake patterns were shifted to cover both blob and interblob regions in a manner similar to that of the patterns obtained with middle-spatial-frequency luminance stimuli. However, in no instance did chromatic gratings produce uptake restricted to the interblob regions, as with the pattern seen with the highest-spatial-frequency luminance gratings. Thus, DG uptake is relatively higher in the interblob regions when comparing luminance with color-varying gratings that are otherwise similar. It was also possible to show DG evidence for receptive-field double-opponency in the upper-layer blobs, but color sensitivity in layer 4Cb appears single-opponent. The DG results suggest that color sensitivity is also high in the lower-layer (layers 5 + 6) blobs, and that many layer 5 receptive fields are double-opponent. Striate layers 4Ca and 4B-appeared color-insensitive in a wide variety of DG tests; this supports the idea of a color-insensitive stream running from the magnocellular LGN layers through striate layers 4Ca and 4B to extrastriate areas MT and V3. There was also a major effect due to wavelength: long and short wavelengths produced much more uptake than did middle wavelengths, even when all colors were equated for luminance and saturation. No variation with eccentricity was seen in cortical color sensitivity, at least between 0 degrees and 10 degrees.},

@article{Edwards1995,
	abstract = {The striate cortex of macaque monkeys contains an array of patches which stain heavily for the enzyme cytochrome oxidase (CO blobs). Cells inside and outside these blobs are often described as belonging to two distinct populations or streams. In order to better understand the function of the CO blobs, we measured the contrast sensitivity and spatial frequency response of single neurons in and around the CO blobs. Density profiles of each blob were assessed using a new quantitative method, and correlations of local CO density with the physiology were noted. We found that the CO density dropped off gradually with distance from blob centers: in a typical blob the CO density dropped from 75% to 25% over 100 microns. Recordings were confined to cortical layers 2/3. Most neurons in these layers have poor contrast sensitivity, similar to that of the parvocellular neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus. However, in a small proportion of layers 2/3 neurons we found higher contrast sensitivity, similar to that of the magnocellular neurons. These neurons were found to cluster near blob centers. This finding is consistent with (indirect) parvocellular input spread uniformly throughout layers 2/3, and (indirect) magnocellular input focused on CO blobs. We also measured spatial tuning curves for both single units and multiple unit activity. In agreement with other workers we found that the optimal spatial frequencies of cells near blob centers were low (median 2.8 c/deg), while the optimal frequencies of cells in the interblob regions were spread over a wide range of spatial frequencies. The high cut-off spatial frequency of multi-unit activity increased with distance from blob centers. We found no correlation between spatial bandwidth and distance from blob centers. All measured physiological properties varied gradually with distance from CO blob centers. This suggests that the view of blob cells subserving visual functions which are entirely distinct from non-blob cells may have to be reevaluated.},

@article{Yu2002,
	abstract = {Neurophysiological and psychophysical evidence indicates that neuronal surround modulation at cross-orientation (orthogonal to the preferred orientation of the classical receptive field) plays a key role in intermediate-level visual tasks, such as textural segregation and perceptual pop-out. What is missing is a psychophysical description of cross surround modulation at the spatial filter level in low-level vision. Moreover, neurophysiological evidence for how cross surround modulation is expressed at the neuronal level has been inconsistent. Here we report evidence for psychophysical facilitation of contrast detection by cross surround stimuli (orthogonal to the target orientation) that may provide insights into both the neurophysiology and psychophysics of cross surround modulation. We found that cross surround facilitation is a surround-contrast dependent effect mainly evident at low surround contrasts, and is narrowly tuned to spatial frequency and broadly tuned to orientation. To understand whether cross surround facilitation results from low-level processing of signal-to-noise enhancement or is due to uncertainty reduction at a higher-level decision stage, we (1) studied cross surround facilitation with an equivalent noise protocol, (2) estimated the changes in the slope of the psychometric function and the uncertainty parameter, M, and (3) measured cross surround effects at the dipper of the TvC function. The converging evidence suggests that cross surround facilitation of contrast detection is mainly a result of low-level signal-to-noise enhancement, and is little affected by uncertainty change.},

We further characterized these two routes psychophysically by measuring the weight of suppression across spatio-temporal frequency for cross-oriented pairs of superimposed flickering Gabor patches. Masking functions were normalized to unmasked detection thresholds and fitted by a two-stage model of contrast gain control (T. S. Meese, M. A. Georgeson, & D. H. Baker, 2006) that was developed to accommodate XOS. The weight of monocular suppression was a power function of the scalar quantity 'speed' (temporal-frequency/spatial-frequency). This weight can be expressed as the ratio of non-oriented magno- and parvo-like mechanisms, permitting a fast-acting, early locus, as benefits the urgency for action associated with high retinal speeds. In contrast, dichoptic-masking functions superimposed. Overall, this (i) provides further evidence for dissociation between the two forms of XOS in humans, and (ii) indicates that the monocular and interocular varieties of XOS are space/time scale-dependent and scale-invariant, respectively. This suggests an image-processing role for interocular XOS that is tailored to natural image statistics-very different from that of the scale-dependent (speed-dependent) monocular variety.},

	abstract = {External noise methods and observer models have been widely used to characterize the intrinsic perceptual limitations of human observers and changes of the perceptual limitations associated with cognitive, developmental, and disease processes by highlighting the variance of internal representations. The authors conducted a comprehensive review of the 5 most prominent observer models through the development of a common formalism. They derived new predictions of the models for a common set of behavioral tests that were compared with the data in the literature and a new experiment. The comparison between the model predictions and the empirical data resulted in very strong constraints on the observer models. The perceptual template model provided the best account of all the empirical data in the visual domain. The choice of the observer model has significant implications for the interpretation of data from other external noise paradigms, as well as studies using external noise to assay changes of perceptual limitations associated with observer states. The empirical and theoretical development suggests possible parallel developments in other sensory modalities and studies of high-level cognitive processes.},

@article{Baker2012b,
	abstract = {The transmission of weak signals through the visual system is limited by internal noise. Its level can be estimated by adding external noise, which increases the variance within the detecting mechanism, causing masking. But experiments with white noise fail to meet three predictions: (a) noise has too small an influence on the slope of the psychometric function, (b) masking occurs even when the noise sample is identical in each two-alternative forced-choice (2AFC) interval, and (c) double-pass consistency is too low. We show that much of the energy of 2D white noise masks extends well beyond the pass-band of plausible detecting mechanisms and that this suppresses signal activity. These problems are avoided by restricting the external noise energy to the target mechanisms by introducing a pedestal with a mean contrast of 0% and independent contrast jitter in each 2AFC interval (termed zero-dimensional [0D] noise). We compared the jitter condition to masking from 2D white noise in double-pass masking and (novel) contrast matching experiments. Zero-dimensional noise produced the strongest masking, greatest double-pass consistency, and no suppression of perceived contrast, consistent with a noisy ideal observer. Deviations from this behavior for 2D white noise were explained by cross-channel suppression with no need to appeal to induced internal noise or uncertainty. We conclude that (a) results from previous experiments using white pixel noise should be re-evaluated and (b) 0D noise provides a cleaner method for investigating internal variability than pixel noise. Ironically then, the best external noise stimulus does not look noisy.},

	abstract = {Staining for the mitochondrial enzyme cytochrome oxidase reveals an array of dense regions (blobs) in the primate primary visual cortex. They are most obvious in the upper layers, 2 and 3, but can also be seen in layers 4B, 5, and 6, in register with the blobs in layers 2 and 3. We compared cells inside and outside blobs in macaque and squirrel monkeys, looking at their physiological responses and anatomical connections. Cells within blobs did not show orientation selectivity, whereas cells between blobs were highly orientation selective. Receptive fields of blob cells had circular symmetry and were of three main types, Broad-Band Center-Surround, Red-Green Double-Opponent, and Yellow-Blue Double-Opponent. Double-Opponent cells responded poorly or not at all to white light in any form, or to diffuse light at any wavelength. In contrast to blob cells, none of the cells recorded in layer 4C beta were Double-Opponent: like the majority of cells in the parvocellular geniculate layers, they were either Broad-Band or Color-Opponent Center-Surround, e.g., red-on-center green-off-surround. To our surprise cells in layer 4C alpha were orientation selective. In tangential penetrations throughout layers 2 and 3, optium orientation, when plotted against electrode position, formed long, regular, usually linear sequences, which were interrupted but not perturbed by the blobs. Staining area 18 for cytochrome oxidase reveals a series of alternating wide and narrow dense stripes, separated by paler interstripes. After small injections of horseradish peroxidase into area 18, we saw a precise set of connections from the blobs in area 17 to thin stripes in area 18, and from the interblob regions in area 17 to interstripes in area 18. Specific reciprocal connections also ran from thin stripes to blobs and from interstripes to interblobs. We have not yet determined the area 17 connections to thick stripes in area 18. In addition, within area 18 there are stripe-to-stripe and interstripe-to-interstripe intrinsic connections. These results suggest that a system involved in the processing of color information, especially color-spatial interactions, runs parallel to and separate from the orientation-specific system. Color, encoded in three coordinates by the major blob cell types, red-green, yellow-blue, and black-white, can be transformed into the three coordinates, red, green, and blue, of the Retinex algorithm of Land.},

	abstract = {How does the human brain combine information across the eyes? It has been known for many years that cortical normalization mechanisms implement 'ocularity invariance': equalizing neural responses to spatial patterns presented either monocularly or binocularly. Here, we used a novel combination of electrophysiology, psychophysics, pupillometry, and computational modeling to ask whether this invariance also holds for flickering luminance stimuli with no spatial contrast. We find dramatic violations of ocularity invariance for these stimuli, both in the cortex and also in the subcortical pathways that govern pupil diameter. Specifically, we find substantial binocular facilitation in both pathways with the effect being strongest in the cortex. Near-linear binocular additivity (instead of ocularity invariance) was also found using a perceptual luminance matching task. Ocularity invariance is, therefore, not a ubiquitous feature of visual processing, and the brain appears to repurpose a generic normalization algorithm for different visual functions by adjusting the amount of interocular suppression.},

However, our perceptions of the world are not fragmentary, so further processes must be involved in stitching it all back together. Simply summing up the responses would not work because this would convey an increase in image contrast with an increase in the number of mechanisms stimulated. Here, we consider a generic model of signal combination and counter-suppression designed to address this problem. The model is derived and tested for simple stimulus pairings (e.g. A + B), but is readily extended over multiple analysers. The model can account for nonlinear contrast transduction, dilution masking, and signal combination at threshold and above. It also predicts nonmonotonic psychometric functions where sensitivity to signal A in the presence of pedestal B first declines with increasing signal strength (paradoxically dropping below 50% correct in two-interval forced choice), but then rises back up again, producing a contour that follows the wings and neck of a swan. We looked for and found these "swan" functions in four different stimulus dimensions (ocularity, space, orientation, and time), providing some support for our proposal.},

	abstract = {We demonstrate a new type of interaction between suprathreshold color (chromatic) and luminance contrast in the context of binocular vision. When two isoluminant colored disks of identical hue but different saturations are presented to different eyes, the apparent saturation of the resulting "dichoptic" mix is close to that of the more saturated patch if presented binocularly. This result is commensurate with previous findings using luminance contrast and is close to the scenario termed "winner-take-all." However, when binocularly matched luminance contrast is added to the dichoptic saturation mixture, the apparent saturation of the mixture shifts away from winner-take-all towards the average of the two dichoptic saturations. The likely cause of this effect is that the matched luminance contrasts reduce the interocular suppression between the unmatched color saturations. We suggest that the presence of binocularly matched luminance contrast promotes the interpretation that the dichoptic color saturations, even though unmatched, nevertheless originate from the same object. We term this idea the "object commonality" hypothesis.},

	abstract = {To decouple interocular suppression and binocular summation we varied the relative phase of mask and target in a 2IFC contrast-masking paradigm. In Experiment I, dichoptic mask gratings had the same orientation and spatial frequency as the target. For in-phase masking, suppression was strong (a log-log slope of approximately 1) and there was weak facilitation at low mask contrasts. Anti-phase masking was weaker (a log-log slope of approximately 0.7) and there was no facilitation. A two-stage model of contrast gain control [Meese, T.S., Georgeson, M.A. and Baker, D.H. (2006). Binocular contrast vision at and above threshold. Journal of Vision, 6: 1224-1243] provided a good fit to the in-phase results and fixed its free parameters. It made successful predictions (with no free parameters) for the anti-phase results when (A) interocular suppression was phase-indifferent but (B) binocular summation was phase sensitive. Experiments II and III showed that interocular suppression comprised two components: (i) a tuned effect with an orientation bandwidth of approximately +/-33 degrees and a spatial frequency bandwidth of >3 octaves, and (ii) an untuned effect that elevated threshold by a factor of between 2 and 4. Operationally, binocular summation was more tightly tuned, having an orientation bandwidth of approximately +/-8 degrees , and a spatial frequency bandwidth of approximately 0.5 octaves. Our results replicate the unusual shapes of the in-phase dichoptic tuning functions reported by Legge [Legge, G.E. (1979). Spatial frequency masking in human vision: Binocular interactions. Journal of the Optical Society of America, 69: 838-847]. These can now be seen as the envelope of the direct effects from interocular suppression and the indirect effect from binocular summation, which contaminates the signal channel with a mask that has been suppressed by the target.},

@article{Georgeson2016,
	abstract = {Our goal here is a more complete understanding of how information about luminance contrast is encoded and used by the binocular visual system. In two-interval forced-choice experiments we assessed observers' ability to discriminate changes in contrast that could be an increase or decrease of contrast in one or both eyes, or an increase in one eye coupled with a decrease in the other (termed IncDec). The base or pedestal contrasts were either in-phase or out-of-phase in the two eyes. The opposed changes in the IncDec condition did not cancel each other out, implying that along with binocular summation, information is also available from mechanisms that do not sum the two eyes' inputs. These might be monocular mechanisms. With a binocular pedestal, monocular increments of contrast were much easier to see than monocular decrements. These findings suggest that there are separate binocular (B) and monocular (L,R) channels, but only the largest of the three responses, max(L,B,R), is available to perception and decision. Results from contrast discrimination and contrast matching tasks were described very accurately by this model. Stimuli, data, and model responses can all be visualized in a common binocular contrast space, allowing a more direct comparison between models and data. Some results with out-of-phase pedestals were not accounted for by the max model of contrast coding, but were well explained by an extended model in which gratings of opposite polarity create the sensation of lustre. Observers can discriminate changes in lustre alongside changes in contrast.},

	abstract = {The changes in apparent brightness or color, induced into a test spot by a surround, can be greatly enhanced either by flickering the test spot between two luminances, or by binocularly fusing a pair of test spots of different luminances. Simultaneous contrast, in which a white surround makes a grey spot look darker, is greatly enhanced if the spot (not the surround) flickers between black and white. Colour contrast is likewise enhanced by chromatic flicker: on a blue surround, a grey spot looks slightly yellowish, but a yellow/blue flickering spot looks strongly yellow. Temporal successive contrasts, or negative afterimages, are also enhanced by flickering the test field. The negative afterimage of a half-white, half-black rectangle looked dark grey and light grey when projected on a grey test field, but it looked almost black and almost white when projected on a test field that flickered between black and white. Coloured negative afterimages were also enhanced by projecting them on a chromatic flickering test field. We examined the combination rules for pairs of luminances which were presented either successively as flicker or else dichoptically (and fused binocularly). The brightness averaging functions for spatial increments (light spots) on dark surrounds were quasi-linear for binocular fusion but quadratic for flicker. For spatial decrements (dark spots) on white surrounds, the brightness averaging functions were strongly nonlinear winner-take-all for both binocular fusion and flicker. We also found temporal analogues of Fechner's [(1860). Elements of psychophysics. New York: Holt, Rinehart, Winston, 1966] paradox and Levelt's [(1965). British Journal of Psychology, 56, 1-13] dichoptic contour effect. We conclude that the visual rules for combining luminance excursions, whether in flicker or binocular fusion, favour disproportionately the spot with the higher contrast.},

	abstract = {We studied the rules by which visual responses to luminous targets are combined across the two eyes. Previous work has found very different forms of binocular combination for targets defined by increments and by decrements of luminance, with decrement data implying a severe nonlinearity before binocular combination. We ask whether this difference is due to the luminance of the target, the luminance of the background, or the sign of the luminance excursion. We estimated the pre-binocular nonlinearity (power exponent) by fitting a computational model to ocular equibrightness matches. The severity of the nonlinearity had a monotonic dependence on the signed difference between target and background luminance. For dual targets, in which there was both a luminance increment and a luminance decrement (e.g. contrast), perception was governed largely by the decrement. The asymmetry in the nonlinearities derived from the subjective matching data made a clear prediction for visual performance: there should be more binocular summation for detecting luminance increments than for detecting luminance decrements. This prediction was confirmed by the results of a subsequent experiment. We discuss the relation between these results and luminance nonlinearities such as a logarithmic transform, as well as the involvement of contemporary model architectures of binocular vision.},

	abstract = {While contrast normalization is well known to occur in luminance vision between overlaid achromatic contrasts, and in colour vision between overlaid colour contrasts, it is unknown whether it transfers between colour and luminance contrast. Here we investigate whether contrast detection in colour vision can be normalized by achromatic contrast, or whether this is a selective process driven only by colour contrast. We use a method of cross-orientation masking, in which colour detection is masked by cross-oriented achromatic contrast, over a range of spatio-temporal frequencies (0.375-1.5 cpd, 2-8 Hz). We find that there is virtually no cross-masking of colour by achromatic contrast under monocular or binocular conditions for any of the spatio-temporal frequencies tested, although we find significant facilitation at low spatio-temporal conditions (0.375 cpd, 2 Hz). These results indicate that the process of contrast normalization is colour selective and independent of achromatic contrast, and imply segregated chromatic signals in early visual processing. Under dichoptic conditions, however, we find a strikingly different result with significant masking of colour by achromatic contrast. This indicates that the dichoptic site of suppression is unselective, responding similarly to colour and luminance contrast, and suggests that dichoptic suppression has a different origin from monocular or binocular suppression.},

	abstract = {Measurement of the detection thresholds of patterns on pedestals of various kinds has the potential of providing insight into the mechanisms that mediate pattern vision. This study is concerned with chromoluminance patterns, that is, patterns that vary over space in luminance, chromaticity, or both. Contrast thresholds for 1 c/deg Gabor patterns (targets) were measured as a function of the contrast of Gabor pedestal patterns (TvC functions), where the pedestals paired with each target were modulated in a wide range of directions in color space. For most target-pedestal pairs, the TvC function decreased (facilitation) and then increased as pedestal contrast increased. The increase went above the absolute contrast threshold (masking) for all target-pedestal pairs except in cases where facilitation occurred at the upper end of the pedestal contrast range. The specific form of the TvC function varied greatly with the target and pedestal, consistent with a general model of pedestal effects proposed by Foley [Journal of the Optical Society of America A, 1994, 11(6)]. There were two sets of target-pedestal pairs for which facilitation did not occur, but masking did occur: pairs in which the target was a luminance modulation and the pedestals were individually isoluminant and pairs in which the pedestal was blue/yellow and the target was in any of our directions except blue/yellow.},

	abstract = {Detection of a Gabor pattern is impaired in the presence of a similar pattern of orthogonal orientation, a phenomenon known as cross-orientation masking (XOM). Here we investigate the role of color in cross-orientation masking. We measured contrast detection thresholds to horizontally oriented Gabors overlaid by similar Gabors of a different orientation. Red-green chromatic masking was compared to achromatic masking for a wide range of spatial and temporal frequencies, orientations, and masks contrasts. We find that cross-orientation masking is significantly greater for chromatic than achromatic contrast. We also find it is invariant with the spatio-temporal conditions used, unlike achromatic cross-orientation masking that is known to have a spatio-temporal dependence (greatest for low spatial frequencies at high temporal frequencies). Furthermore, chromatic masking is isotropic (invariant across the orientation difference between test and mask), whereas the achromatic version of the masking effect displays orientation tuning, a phenomenon that was originally used to indicate the presence of orientationally selective mechanisms in human vision. We conclude that the P cell pathway or its projections can support cross-orientation masking. We propose distinct physiological origins for chromatic and achromatic masking, with a predominantly cortical site for chromatic masking in contrast to the M cell subcortical influences on achromatic masking suggested by previous studies.},

@article{Kim2015,
	abstract = {We investigated the temporal properties of monocular and dichoptic cross-orientation masking (XOM) mediating suppressive or facilitatory cross-channel interactions between the neural detectors for the test and orthogonal mask stimuli. We measured the evolution of masking as a function of the duration of the test and mask stimuli to determine its time constant, and determined its dependence on stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA), for three contrast combinations: color-only (red-green color test and mask), luminance-only (luminance test and mask) and color-luminance (color test and luminance mask). Results show that the temporal properties of monocular and dichoptic masking differ markedly from each other and across contrast type. For the color-only condition, the dichoptic suppressive interaction is significantly longer than for the monocular one and both are largely independent of SOA. For the luminance-only condition, the suppressive interactions in both presentations are faster than for color, have similar time constants, but have different dependencies on SOA. For the color-luminance condition under the monocular conditions, cross-orientation facilitation (XOF) occurs with the luminance mask speeding up the processing of the color test with greatest XOF when the luminance mask precedes the color test by around 22 ms. No significant effects are observed for the dichoptic condition. Effects are invariant across spatial frequency. These strongly differential dynamic effects suggest that there is separate encoding of color contrast, luminance contrast, and their combination at the relatively early within-eye stage of processing, which is distinct from the dichoptic site.},

	abstract = {Cross-orientation masking (XOM) occurs when the detection of a test grating is masked by a superimposed grating at an orthogonal orientation, and is thought to reveal the suppressive effects mediating contrast normalization. Medina and Mullen (2009) reported that XOM was greater for chromatic than achromatic stimuli at equivalent spatial and temporal frequencies. Here we address whether the greater suppression found in binocular color vision originates from a monocular or interocular site, or both. We measure monocular and dichoptic masking functions for red-green color contrast and achromatic contrast at three different spatial frequencies (0.375, 0.75, and 1.5 cpd, 2 Hz). We fit these functions with a modified two-stage masking model (Meese & Baker, 2009) to extract the monocular and interocular weights of suppression. We find that the weight of monocular suppression is significantly higher for color than achromatic contrast, whereas dichoptic suppression is similar for both. These effects are invariant across spatial frequency. We then apply the model to the binocular masking data using the measured values of the monocular and interocular sources of suppression and show that these are sufficient to account for color binocular masking. We conclude that the greater strength of chromatic XOM has a monocular origin that transfers through to the binocular site.},

@article{Simmons2005,
	abstract = {How is chromatic contrast combined binocularly? One index of binocularity is the binocular contrast summation ratio (BCSR), which is the improvement in contrast sensitivity with binocular rather than monocular presentation. Simmons and Kingdom (1998, Vision Research 38 1063-1071) noted that BCSRs with some red-green isoluminant stimuli were suggestive of full linear summation. This suggestion was investigated further in four subjects by measuring binocular and monocular contrast thresholds for the detection of 0.5 cycle deg(1) isoluminant (red-green) and isochromatic (yellow-black) Gabor patches. These Gabor patches had either vertically or horizontally oriented carrier gratings and were either dichoptically in phase (same coloured bars in binocular correspondence) or in dichoptic anti-phase (opposite coloured bars in binocular correspondence). Full linear summation would be indicated by BCSRs of 2 for the in-phase and close to 0 for the anti-phase conditions. Mean BCSRs at isoluminance were 1.93 and 0.90, respectively, for the in-phase and anti-phase stimuli with horizontal carriers, the former being consistent with full linear summation, but the latter not. Despite these results, BCSRs obtained with isoluminant and isochromatic stimuli under similar conditions were not statistically distinguishable from each other, although there was a tendency for summation at isoluminance with in-phase stimuli to be higher and anti-phase stimuli to be lower. These data fall short of demonstrating full linear summation of chromatic contrast between the eyes under all presentation conditions, but they do indicate that there are strong binocular interactions at red-green isoluminance, which are similar to, and possibly even stronger than, those obtained with luminance stimuli.},

However, the present study suggests that inputs from two eyes are summed in different ways. Foley's model was revised to describe TvC functions for binocular, monocular and dichoptic masking. The revised model has the following two characteristics. First, the revised model receives two monocular inputs. Secondly, excitations and inhibitory signals are subjected to nonlinear transducer functions before and after summation of the monocular signals. A two-alternative forced-choice procedure was used to measure contrast thresholds for Gaussian windowed sine-wave gratings (target) in the presence of sine-wave gratings (masker). Thresholds were measured for 11 masker contrasts and the three masking conditions. It was shown that this revised model fitted the data resonably well. The revised model indicates how monocular inputs are summed in contrast processing.},

	abstract = {Binocular contrast interactions in human vision were studied psychophysically. Thresholds were obtained for sinewave grating stimulation of the right eye in the presence of simultaneous masking gratings presented to the right eye (monocular masking) or left eye (dichoptic masking). In the first experiment, thresholds were measured at 0.25, 1.0, 4.0, and 16.0 cycle per degree (cpd) as a function of the contrast of masking gratings of identical frequency and phase. Thresholds rose nonmonotonically with masking contrast. At medium and high contrast levels, dichoptic masking was more effective in elevating contrast thresholds than monocular masking, and approached Weber's Law behavior. In the second experiment, spatial frequency tuning functions were obtained for test gratings at five spatial frequencies, by measuring threshold elevation as a function of the spatial frequency of constant-contrast masking gratings. At 1.0, 4.0, and 16.0 cpd, the tuning functions peaked at the test frequencies. The dichoptic tuning functions had a bandwidth of about 1 octave between half-maximum points, narrower than +/- 1 octave bandwidths of the monocular tuning functions. At 0.125 and 0.25 cpd, the tuning functions were broader and exhibited a shift in peak masking to frequencies above the test frequencies.},

@article{Baker2018,
	abstract = {Our ability to detect faint images is better with two eyes than with one, but how great is this improvement? A meta-analysis of 65 studies published across more than 5 decades shows definitively that psychophysical binocular summation (the ratio of binocular to monocular contrast sensitivity) is significantly greater than the canonical value of √2. Several methodological factors were also found to affect summation estimates. Binocular summation was significantly affected by both the spatial and temporal frequency of the stimulus, and stimulus speed (the ratio of temporal to spatial frequency) systematically predicts summation levels, with slow speeds (high spatial and low temporal frequencies) producing the strongest summation. We furthermore show that empirical summation estimates are affected by the ratio of monocular sensitivities, which varies across individuals, and is abnormal in visual disorders such as amblyopia. A simple modeling framework is presented to interpret the results of summation experiments. In combination with the empirical results, this model suggests that there is no single value for binocular summation, but instead that summation ratios depend on methodological factors that influence the strength of a nonlinearity occurring early in the visual pathway, before binocular combination of signals. Best practice methodological guidelines are proposed for obtaining accurate estimates of neural summation in future studies, including those involving patient groups with impaired binocular vision.

@article{Moradi2009,
	abstract = {The brain combines visual information from the two eyes and forms a coherent percept, even when inputs to the eyes are different. However, it is not clear how inputs from the two eyes are combined in visual cortex. We measured fMRI responses to single gratings presented monocularly, or pairs of gratings presented monocularly or dichoptically with several combinations of contrasts. Gratings had either the same orientation or orthogonal orientations (i.e., plaids). Observers performed a demanding task at fixation to minimize top-down modulation of the stimulus-evoked responses. Dichoptic presentation of compatible gratings (same orientation) evoked greater activity than monocular presentation of a single grating only when contrast was low (<10%). A model that assumes linear summation of activity from each eye failed to explain binocular responses at 10% contrast or higher. However, a model with binocular contrast normalization, such that activity from each eye reduced the gain for the other eye, fitted the results very well. Dichoptic presentation of orthogonal gratings evoked greater activity than monocular presentation of a single grating for all contrasts. However, activity evoked by dichoptic plaids was equal to that evoked by monocular plaids. Introducing an onset asynchrony (stimulating one eye 500 ms before the other, which under attentive vision results in flash suppression) had no impact on the results; the responses to dichoptic and monocular plaids were again equal. We conclude that when attention is diverted, inter-ocular suppression in V1 can be explained by a normalization model in which the mutual suppression between orthogonal orientations does not depend on the eye of origin, nor on the onset times, and cross-orientation suppression is weaker than inter-ocular (same orientation) suppression.},

We tested several computational models against data from steady-state electroencephalography (EEG) experiments in humans, using periodic visual stimuli combined across either retinal location or eye-of-presentation. A model in which signals are raised to an exponent before being summed in both the numerator and the denominator of a gain control nonlinearity gave the best account of the data. This model also predicted the pattern of responses in a range of additional conditions accurately and with no free parameters, as well as predicting responses at harmonic and intermodulation frequencies between 1 and 30 Hz. We speculate that this model implements the optimal algorithm for combining multiple noisy inputs, in which responses are proportional to the weighted sum of both inputs. This suggests a novel purpose for cortical gain control: implementing optimal signal combination via mutual inhibition, perhaps explaining its ubiquity as a neural computation.},

Here we extend that work by: (i) exploring the two-dimensional stimulus space (defined by left- and right-eye contrasts) more thoroughly, and (ii) performing contrast discrimination and contrast matching tasks for the same stimuli. Twenty-five base-stimuli made from 1 c/deg patches of horizontal grating, were defined by the factorial combination of 5 contrasts for the left eye (0.3-32%) with five contrasts for the right eye (0.3-32%). Other than in contrast, the gratings in the two eyes were identical. In a 2IFC discrimination task, the base-stimuli were masks (pedestals), where the contrast increment was presented to one eye only. In a matching task, the base-stimuli were standards to which observers matched the contrast of either a monocular or binocular test grating. In the model, discrimination depends on the local gradient of the observer's internal contrast-response function, while matching equates the magnitude (rather than gradient) of response to the test and standard. With all model parameters fixed by previous work, the two-stage model successfully predicted both the discrimination and the matching data and was much more successful than linear or quadratic binocular summation models. These results show that performance measures and perception (contrast discrimination and contrast matching) can be understood in the same theoretical framework for binocular contrast vision.},

@article{Dougherty2019,
	abstract = {In humans and other primates, sensory signals from each eye remain separated until they arrive in the primary visual cortex (V1), but their exact meeting point is unknown. In V1, some neurons respond to stimulation of only one eye (monocular neurons), while most neurons respond to stimulation of either eye (binocular neurons). The main input layers of V1 contain most of the monocular neurons while binocular neurons dominate the layers above and below. This observation has given rise to the idea that the two eyes' signals remain separate until they converge outside V1's input layers. Here, we show that, despite responding to only one eye, monocular neurons in all layers, including the input layers, of V1 discriminate between stimulation of their driving eye alone and stimulation of both eyes. Some monocular V1 neurons' responses were significantly enhanced, or facilitated, when both eyes were stimulated. Binocular facilitation within V1's input layers tended to occur at the onset of the visual response, which could be explained by converging thalamocortical inputs. However, most V1 monocular neurons were significantly reduced, or suppressed, to binocular stimulation. In contrast to facilitation, binocular suppression occurred several milliseconds following the onset of the visual response, suggesting that the bulk of binocular modulation involves cortical inhibition. These findings, combined, suggest that binocular signals arise at an earlier processing stage than previously appreciated, as even so-called monocular neurons in V1's input layers encode what is shown to both eyes.},

@article{Carpenter2017,
	abstract = {Stan is a probabilistic programming language for specifying statistical models. A Stan program imperatively defines a log probability function over parameters conditioned on specified data and constants. As of version 2.14.0, Stan provides full Bayesian inference for continuous-variable models through Markov chain Monte Carlo methods such as the No-U-Turn sampler, an adaptive form of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling. Penalized maximum likelihood estimates are calculated using optimization methods such as the limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. Stan is also a platform for computing log densities and their gradients and Hessians, which can be used in alternative algorithms such as variational Bayes, expectation propagation, and marginal inference using approximate integration. To this end, Stan is set up so that the densities, gradients, and Hessians, along with intermediate quantities of the algorithm such as acceptance probabilities, are easily accessible. Stan can be called from the command line using the cmdstan package, through R using the rstan package, and through Python using the pystan package. All three interfaces support sampling and optimization-based inference with diagnostics and posterior analysis. rstan and pystan also provide access to log probabilities, gradients, Hessians, parameter transforms, and specialized plotting.},

@article{Schutt2016,
	abstract = {The psychometric function describes how an experimental variable, such as stimulus strength, influences the behaviour of an observer. Estimation of psychometric functions from experimental data plays a central role in fields such as psychophysics, experimental psychology and in the behavioural neurosciences. Experimental data may exhibit substantial overdispersion, which may result from non-stationarity in the behaviour of observers. Here we extend the standard binomial model which is typically used for psychometric function estimation to a beta-binomial model. We show that the use of the beta-binomial model makes it possible to determine accurate credible intervals even in data which exhibit substantial overdispersion. This goes beyond classical measures for overdispersion-goodness-of-fit-which can detect overdispersion but provide no method to do correct inference for overdispersed data. We use Bayesian inference methods for estimating the posterior distribution of the parameters of the psychometric function. Unlike previous Bayesian psychometric inference methods our software implementation-psignifit 4-performs numerical integration of the posterior within automatically determined bounds. This avoids the use of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods typically requiring expert knowledge. Extensive numerical tests show the validity of the approach and we discuss implications of overdispersion for experimental design. A comprehensive MATLAB toolbox implementing the method is freely available; a python implementation providing the basic capabilities is also available.},

@article{Meese2006,
	abstract = {A fundamental problem for any visual system with binocular overlap is the combination of information from the two eyes. Electrophysiology shows that binocular integration of luminance contrast occurs early in visual cortex, but a specific systems architecture has not been established for human vision. Here, we address this by performing binocular summation and monocular, binocular, and dichoptic masking experiments for horizontal 1 cycle per degree test and masking gratings. These data reject three previously published proposals, each of which predict too little binocular summation and insufficient dichoptic facilitation. However, a simple development of one of the rejected models (the twin summation model) and a completely new model (the two-stage model) provide very good fits to the data. Two features common to both models are gently accelerating (almost linear) contrast transduction prior to binocular summation and suppressive ocular interactions that contribute to contrast gain control. With all model parameters fixed, both models correctly predict (1) systematic variation in psychometric slopes, (2) dichoptic contrast matching, and (3) high levels of binocular summation for various levels of binocular pedestal contrast. A review of evidence from elsewhere leads us to favor the two-stage model.},
