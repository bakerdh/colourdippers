Note that to run this code, you will also require the psychophysics toolbox, and the Computational Colour Science toolbox. These are available from:

http://psychtoolbox.org/

https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/40640-computational-colour-science-using-matlab-2e

You should install both toolboxes and ensure they are present on the Matlab path.
